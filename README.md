## What is 'I am Rich' App?

_**I Am Rich**_ is an [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS") application developed by **Armin Heinrich** and which was distributed using the [App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS) "App Store (iOS)"). When launched, the screen only contains a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displays the following [mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra "Mantra") in large text.

> I am rich   
> I deserv [_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic
> "Sic")_] it   
> I am good,   
> healthy & successful

The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it;

  _I Am Rich_ was sold on the App Store for US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,187 in 2019), €799.99, and GB£599.99 (equivalent to £806.54 in 2019), the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content.

The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") the day after its release, August 6, 2008.
